# How to Install
If you don't already have a userscript manager installed in your browser, I would recommend one of these:

* [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) (**Firefox 57+**, **Chrome**)
* [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) (**Edge**, **Opera**, **Safari**)
* [Greasemonkey 3](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/versions/?page=1#version-3.17) (**Firefox 56 or older**, make sure to prevent it from updating)

Pick whichever scripts you want from the list below, and click the link to install them. The userscript manager will automatically update all installed scripts, however since these scripts are quite simple and updates may change how they work, each of them has an alternative link that will never update.

If you want to [report an issue](https://github.com/chylex/Userscripts/issues/new) (bug report or feature request) for one of the scripts, please make sure you're using the most recent version of that script, and search for [existing issues](https://github.com/chylex/Userscripts/issues) in case it's already been reported.
